# Brent's Oil Price Prediction, Time-Series

•	Predicted oil prices for next 5 years. Performed Data Scrubbing & Exploratory Data Analysis.

•	Implemented Simple Forecasting Methods such as Avg Method, Naïve/ Seasonal Naïve Method, Drift Method.

•	Applied Forecasting Methods such as Exponential Smoothing, Holt’s Linear method, Autocorrelation and ARIMA.

•	Found that Drift Method is best for weekly and monthly data, while ARIMA model is best for the yearly data.
